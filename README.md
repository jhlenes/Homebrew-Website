# Homebrew
This repository contains the website for Homebrew. Homebrew is a fermentation temperature controller for brewing beer which runs on Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. Through the website you are able set new temperature curves which the system will follow. You can also see graphs showing the temperature variation in previous fermentation processes.
